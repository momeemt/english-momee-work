# I introduce my favorite song!

Hi! I introduce my favorite song!  
I like Clean Bandit. Do you know it?  
It is a group of electronic. Jack Paterson, Luke Paterson and Grace Chatto organize it.  
They compose an individual song, mixture classic music and DeskTop Music.  

## Stronger
My favorite song is Stronger.  
Of course, its wonderful point is music, but also its lyrics is impressed so much.  
I don't always listen lyrics of musics. Nevertheless, Stronger has attractive power.  
Favorite part is 'If I could be stronger would you believe That I could love you like you want me to?'.
