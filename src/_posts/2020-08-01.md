# I found a music which is so good for me.

Hi! I found a music which is so good for me.  
I like a wide range of music genre, especially I love it because this is emotional.  
The band I want to introcude is 'allicholy'.  
They are four peaces band and their concept is '(We want to provide) the songs are able to cuddle melancholic everyday.'  
Their music is warm, calm, and emotional.  
Particularly, my favorite song is リフレイン (Refrain). Its theme may be broken heart.  
I was made an impression by its lyric that is 'I might remember yesterday that is like abandoning to leave a plastic umbrella somewhere.'
