# What do you say to Nim?
I keep an English diary after a long time.  
Today, I introduce the Nim language.  
I plan to write textbook of it like a math textbook, because university students and high school students used it.  
Particularly, I have never seen a standard exercise books of programming language.  
I also want to develop solver of problems and provide for purchasing people.  
Nim has such a high speed and easy to understanding syntax.  
It can connect C, C++, Objective-C, JavaScript, Python and Java.  
Ofcause, you are able to program front-end and server-end of web technology, system of embedded, and like shell scripts.  
Theoretically, you'll develop mobile application! (As Nim can compile Objective-C and transport Java, but somebody must provide very huge framework. You?)  
I'm going to report you about Nim textbook!  
See you!
