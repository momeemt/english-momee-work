# I have created my blog!
Hi. I am Momiyama(@momeemt).  
I decided to write articles in English, because I want to talk English with flequency but I can't write in it well.  
My hobby is programming, so I will post about information technology.  

## About Tree Structure
Today, I introduce tree structure.  
It is data structure which can construct hirerarchical structure.  
It has nodes and edges.  
In the figure, node is circle, edge is line.

### rooted tree
If a tree structure has root which is distinguished node, it is called rooted tree.  
Worthy of a special mention, it has parent-child relationship.  
Depth of root node is 0, and depth of nodes which are connecting root node is 1.  
In this way, the relation that connecting and depth of nodes is 1 more than the node is parent-child relationship.  
By the way, the relation that nodes are same depth as the node is sibling.  
The node which does not have child-node is called 'external node' or 'leaf'.  

## Impression
Writing this article in English is very hard work, so I cannot make detailed information.  
I am not good at English, but I want to do my best posting article everyday.
