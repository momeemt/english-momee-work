# I had a meeting for PCK.
Hi. I had a meeting for PCK (Personal Computer Koshien).  
PCK is the competition of the personal computer which is for junior and senior high school students.  
I am going to participate it, so I gathered members and we began to plan our mobile application.  
This year's theme is 'food and health'. We think this is very difficult theme.  
However, we decided detailed plan, and we are working preparation!  
If we go to the main game, please support us!  
Good night.
