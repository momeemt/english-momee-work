# July is over.

Hi. It is 31st July, so July is over.  
This condition fits like 'Time flies.' bacause these are terrible busy by COVID-19 on last month.  
I had some sham exams, for instance, 'Sundai sham exam', 'Shinken sham exam', and 'G-TEC'. I was recieved results of these and they were very very tebrrible.  
They showed about current me as I certain didn't study hard until today.  
I have reflected my lifestyle.  
I will have to improve it, and work studying for my future.  

## Target
I am going to take the English Proficiency Test Pre.1.  
I know no enough English knowledge.  
Especially, I am not good at listening.  
I will do effort for English during this summer vacation.
