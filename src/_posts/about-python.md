# I have started studying Python.
Hi. Today, I will talk about Python.  
You know, Python is a very popular plogramming language.  
They use it to develop artificial intelligence, to process images, and to make web applications, etc...  
I am working image processing recently, so I will explain environmental structure and easy image processing.  

## pyenv
I omit to explain installing Python because everyone may know it.  
We often want to toggle versions of programming language.  
This hope is able to be resolved by 'pyenv'. It is 'simple Python version management'.  

### Install pyenv
As using operation system of my PC is MacOS, I used installing Homebrew.  

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

This is so easy to understand.  
By the way, as pyenv is open source software, you can contribute it when you find bugs and troubles. 

## pip
You already got 'pip' when you installed pyenv.  
pip is package management system. (If you have ever written in JavaScript, you may know 'npm' or 'yarn'.)  
You can get many packages of Python easily because pip works complex things.  

### Install OpenCV
I want to develop in OpenCV, so I installed it by pip.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## summary
I did environmental structure and [easy image processing](https://github.com/momeemt/OpenCV_learn/tree/tottori-opencv-tutorial/tottori-u-opencv).  
I want to study numpy, Flask, natural language processing, of course, and image processing!  
Studying Python is very deep inside, I want to do my best!
