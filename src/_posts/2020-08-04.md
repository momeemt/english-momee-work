# Introduce your city(town) in English.

Today, I introduce my hometown that Shiga Prefecture where I was born in.  
It has the largest lake in Japan and it is Biwa Lake.  
When I was a elemental school student, I caught with my uncle in there.  
In fact, many exotic species live there so we throw release-area caught fish because they devour native species.  
I stop this diary as I am sleeping now! Good Night!
