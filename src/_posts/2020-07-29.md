# I planned the graduation thesis.

Hi. I planned the graduation thesis.  
I take a general class in my school, and it let us write the thesis.  
I decided that the theme of my study is a relation of image procession and optical illusion.  
When it was the COVID-19 vacation, I thought that it can generate images of optical illusion to detect feature value of these.  
If I'll be able to develop the system, optical illusion having context can operate human.  
As it induces right direction where is many people, for example Comic Market, queue of tapioka drink, everybody moves there in unconsciously.  

## The way

First of all, I will search feature value of optical illusion.  
It has concern that is these pictures has very simple construction, so I will not discover helpful data.  
At that time, I should pick some images of optical illusion, and I generate like a these by Style Gan. (By the way, Style Gan is generative adversarial network. It is unsupervised learning.)

## Conclusion

Wanting to study machine learning, I am so existing!  
I am going to complete this study!
