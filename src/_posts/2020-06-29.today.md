# I developed Unit.
Hi. I developed Unit that is nim module for the international units.  
I made unit type of mass and lenngth.  
For example,  

```nim
echo $(150.5.kg - 100.75.kg)
```

you can express unit like a natural language.  
Of course, you can mixture differet unit.  

```nim
echo $(1.kg - 10e5.mg)
```

I am goint to publish Unit of beta version by this week!
